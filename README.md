# Vornoi Diagram of Singapore MRT (before the introduction of TEL)

The Thompson-East Coast Line (TEL) is a new part of Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. Some of the stations on the line are operational, and the remaining stations will be active by 2025.

To identify if the stations effectively connect areas without access to the MRT, I overlayed the population density data on top of the Singapore map. Then I constructed a Voronoi diagram using the existing MRT lines and overlayed the TEL stations on top of it.

This project uses the D3.js library.
